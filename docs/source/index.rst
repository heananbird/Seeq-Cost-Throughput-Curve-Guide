Cost Curve Documentation
========================

This documentation outlines the analytic process used to create metrics to measure the cost and throughput from XPS production lines across the company.


Cost Throughput Curves
----------------------

The Cost Throughput Curve addon user guide can be found in :doc:`Cost Throughput Curve <cost>`. This addon uses the calculated metrics to provide a graphic representation about the current and past performance of lines when compared against their cost and throughput.
